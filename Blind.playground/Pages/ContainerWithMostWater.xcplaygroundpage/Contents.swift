 ## [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
 [__Array__] [__Medium__]

 You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

 Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

 Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

 __Notice__ that you may not slant the container.
