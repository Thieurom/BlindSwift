 ## [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
 [__Linked List__] [__Easy__]

 Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

 There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. __Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter__.

 Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.
